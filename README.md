# NodeJS Test API

A public, testable API for Nano API users to explore the functionality of the build process on a NodeJS backend.

## Getting Started

This API is built using NodeJS and Express. It is designed to be deployed via [Nano API](https://nanoapi.io), but can be run locally as well.

To test out Nano API's build process, go ahead an fork this repository, and then follow the instructions on the [Nano API docs to deploy your own version of this API](https://docs.nanoapi.io/tutorial/simple-api).

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
